If you also want HOPE to perform the tasks that require your attention then you just need to perform a simple task. 

I will be explaining you the way by which you can enable HOPE to perform all the tasks with an example:- 

Suppose you want HOPE to open Visual Studio Code for you then you need right click on "Visual Studio Code" icon where there will be an option named "Properties" you need to select that option. Then in properties there will be an option named "Shortcut" you need to select that. Then in Shortcut menu a path is written in "Target" option like "C:\Users\pc\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe" so you need to paste it in the "visPath" option that is in line no. 96. You also need to add an extra back-slash(\) to the Target path of VS code so that it changes to "C:\\Users\\pc\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\Code.exe".

You need to do the same process explained above with the other tasks.
